# PythonMazeSearch
a maze generator (support 4 maze generation algorithms) and path search using A* algorithm
* support Recursive Backtracker, Randomized Prim, Recursive Division and Union Find Set algorithms
* add a maze display by pygame
* add a path search using A* algorithm

# Introduce
This project only include four simple .py files:

* GameMap.py: define a class map and is used to generat or display a maze.
* MazeGenerator.py: support 4 maze generation algorithms
* GameSearch.py: a maze display by pygame
* AStarSearch.py: use A* algorithm to find a path

# Requirement
* Python 3.7
* Python-Pygame 1.9

# How To Start Game
$ python GameSearch.py

# How to Play
* mouse click button to choose one of the four maze generation algorithms
* clcik any keyboard to do actions sequencely: generate a maze, generate start and destination point, find a path and clear the map

# Demo
